# LuaGObject User's Guide

All LuaGObject functionality is exported through the `LuaGObject` module. To
access it, call `require 'LuaGObject'`:

    local LuaGObject = require 'LuaGObject'

## 1. Importing libraries

To use any GObject library which enables GObject-Introspection, it has to be
imported first. The easiest way to do this is by simply referencing its
namespace on the LuaGObject table like so:

    local GLib = LuaGObject.GLib
    local GObject = LuaGObject.GObject
    local Gtk = LuaGObject.Gtk

This imports the latest version of the module which can be found.
To import an exact version of a module, call
`LuaGObject.require(name, version)`:

    local Gst = LuaGObject.require('Gst', '0.10')

### 1.1. Repository Structure

Importing a library creates a table containing all elements present in that
library's namespace—all classes, structures, global functions, constants etc.
All of these elements are directly accessible, for instance:

    assert(GLib.PRIORITY_DEFAULT == 0)

All elements in a namespace are lazy-loaded in order to prevent excessive
memory use and greatly speed up the initial load time. LuaGObject adds a method
called `_resolve(deep)` to each namespace to force eager loading (recursively,
if `deep` is `true`), so:

    dump(Gtk.Widget:_resolve(true), 3)

This prints everything available in Gtk.Widget class, and

    dump(Gio:_resolve(true), 5)

dumps the entire contents of the Gio package.

Note: the `dump` function used in this manual is from `cli-debugger` and not
LuaGObject. You can easily substitute for another similar function.

## 2. Mapping Types Between GLib and Lua

In order to call GObject methods and access GObject properties and fields from
Lua, LuaGObject establishes a mapping between GLib types and Lua types.

* `void` is ignored, and does not produce any Lua value
* `gboolean` is mapped to Lua's `boolean` type, with `true` and
  `false` values
* All numeric types are mapped to Lua's `number` type
* Enumerations are primarily handled as strings with uppercased GType
  nicks, optionally the direct numeric values are also accepted.
* Bitflags are primarily handled as lists or sets of strings with
  uppercased GType nicks, optionally the direct numeric values are
  also accepted.
* `gchar *` string is mapped to Lua as `string` type, encoded in UTF-8
* C array types and `GArray` are mapped to Lua tables, using the array part
  of the table. Although in C the arrays are 0-based, when copied to Lua table,
  they are 1-based (as Lua uses 1-based arrays).
* `GList` and `GSList` are also mapped to the array part of Lua tables
* `GHashTable` is mapped to Lua table, fully utilizing key-value and
  GHashTable's key and value pairs.
* C arrays of 1-byte-sized elements (i.e. byte buffers) are mapped to
  Lua strings instead of tables, although when going from Lua to GLib,
  tables are also accepted for this type of array.
* GObject classes, structs, and unions are mapped to LuaGObject instances of
  each specific class, struct, or union. It is also possible to pass `nil`,
  in which case the `NULL` pointer is passed to C-side (but only if the
  parameter or property are given the annotation `(allow-none)` in the original
  C method to allow passing `NULL`).
* `gpointer` values are mapped to Lua's `lightuserdata` type. When passing from
  Lua to GLib, the following are acceptable for `gpointer` types:
    - Lua strings instances
    - Instances of LuaGObject classes, structs, or unions
    - Binary buffers (see below)

### 2.1. Calling Functions and Methods

When calling GLib functions, the following conventions apply:

* The parameters passed from the Lua side map to the function's `input`
  parameters
* The first value returned to Lua is the function's return value (if it exists)
* All parameters marked as `output` are returned as multiple-return values
  (after the function's native return value, if it exists)
* In/out parameters are accepted as parameters, and also returned as
  multiple-return values
* Functions which report errors through `GError **` pointer parameters
  instead use Lua's standard error reporting—they typically return a boolean
  value indicating success or failure, also returning an error message and
  error code as multiple-return values

#### 2.1.1. Phantom Boolean Return Values

GLib-based libraries often use a boolean return value to indicate whether
an output argument has been filled or not. A typical example would be
`gboolean gtk_tree_model_get_iter_first(GtkTreeModel *tree_model, GtkTreeIter *iter)`
where the value pointed by `iter` is filled if the method is successful, but
untouched if it fails. Binding functions in this way feels unnatural in Lua:

    local ok, iter = model:get_iter_first()
    -- Even in case of failure, iter contains new 0-initialized
    -- instance of the iterator, so the following line is necessary:
    if not ok then iter = nil end

For ease of usage of such methods, LuaGObject avoids returning the first
boolean return value. If a C function returns `false` in this case, all other
output arguments are returned as `nil` instead. This means that the previous
example must be written as:

    local iter = model:get_iter_first()

If the returned `iter` is `nil`, then the function failed. Otherwise, it was
successful.

### 2.2. Callbacks

If a GLib function requires a callback function, a Lua function should be
passed (or alternatively, a userdata or table implementing the `__call`
metamethod), and the position for the callback context (usually a `gpointer`
called `user_data` in the C function signature) is ignored completely. Callbacks
are invoked in the context of a Lua coroutine which invoked the original call,
unless that coroutine is suspended—in this case, a new coroutine is
automatically created and the callback is invoked within this new context.

Callback arguments and return values are governed by the same rules as
other argument and type conversions noted above. If the Lua callback throws an
error, the error is *not* caught by the site calling the callback. It is instead
propagated out to the originally caller (you) and will terminate your
application unless `pcall` was called somewhere in the chain.

It is also possible to provide a coroutine instance as a callback argument. If
so, the coroutine is resumed at callback time, and callback parameters are
provided to `coroutine.resume()` (which become the return values for
a previous `coroutine.yield()` call that suspended the coroutine). The callback
is considered to have returned either if the coroutine terminates (with the
final return values are used as the callback's return values) or the coroutine
is yielded a second time (in which case the parameters passed to
`coroutine.yield()` are used as the callbacks return values).

While coroutines are very useful as callbacks when using Gio-style asynchronous
calls, it is recommended to use LuaGObject's own `Gio.Async` override to call
asynchronous functions as described in [its own documentation](async.md)
because it wraps many of the intricacies which may arise in the interaction
between Lua coroutines and GLib's main loop.

## 3. Classes

To create a new class, it must be derived directly or indirectly from the
`GObject` base class. Classes contain entities (properties, methods, and
signals) while also providing a mechanism for inheritance—the ancestor's
entities become part of a descendent class. LuaGObject supports Lua-like
access to an object's entities using the dereference operators `.` and `[name]`,
as well as through the method call operator `:`.

Manual memory management is unnecessary when using LuaGObject, as it handles
all reference counting under the hood. Calling low-level `_ref` and `_unref`
methods will usually lead to undesired behaviour, and is not recommended.

### 3.1. Creating instances

To create a new instance of a class (i.e.: a new object), call the class
name as if it was a function:

    local window = Gtk.Window()

Optionally, if the class has an underlying constructor taking no arguments,
LuaGObject will expose constructor semantics allowing properties to be
initialized by passing a single table parameter:

    local window = Gtk.Window {
        title = 'Made using LuaGObject',
    }

It is even possible to create an instance of a class for which
GObject-Introspection typelib data is unavailable and only the GType is known by
calling `GObject.Object.new()` as shown below:

    local gtype = 'ForeignWidget'
    local widget = GObject.Object.new(gtype)
    local window = Adw.Window {
        title = 'Contains a Foreign Widget',
        content = widget,
    }

### 3.2. Calling Methods

Methods are functions belonging to a class and intended to operate on a
specific class instance. GObject achieves this by passing a pointer to an
instance as the first argument, but in LuaGObject you are intended to use the
`:` operator on an object such as calling `window:present()` (where `window` is
a `Gtk.Window` object). As is the convention in Lua, this is identical to
calling `window.present(window)`.

Methods are also available on the class itself and it is possible to invoke
methods without using the object notation, so the previous examples may also be
rewritten as `Gtk.Window.present(window)`. Doing this removes the dynamic
lookup of a class' overridden methods, but it's worth noting that if `window` is
an instance of a descendent type, this will avoid calling the descendant's
overridden `:present()` method if it exists. In other words, this call
convention ignores any potential `gtk_window_descendent_present()` method and
instead calls directly to the underlying `gtk_window_present()` method. While
this is usually not what you want, it is still sometimes desirable.

#### 3.2.1. Static Methods

Static methods (i.e.: class functions which do not take an instance as the first
argument) are usually invoked from the class' namespace, e.g:
`Gtk.Window.list_toplevels()`. A very common form of static methods are `new`
constructors such as `Gtk.Window.new()`. In most cases, `new` constructors are
provided only as a convenience for programmers who expect C-like object
instantiation—in LuaGObject, it is preferable to use the construction syntax
outlined in section 3.1 of this document.

### 3.3. Accessing Properties

An object's properties are accessed using Lua's `.` operator. So, to amend a
`Gtk.Window`'s title, on can write `window.title = window.tile .. ' - new'`.
Within GObject's system, property and signal names can contain a `-` character,
which is cumbersome to user in Lua. For convenience, LuaGObject maps the dashes
in property and signal names to underscore (`_`) characters. Therefore, one can
access a window's `can-focus` property by using the name `can_focus` from Lua:

    window.can_focus = true

### 3.4. Signals

As with properties, dashes in signal names are mapped to underscores.
Additionally LuaGObject adds a prefix `on_` to a signal's name when mapping it.

#### 3.4.1. Connecting to Signals

Assigning a Lua function to a signal will connect to the given signal as a new
event handler. The event handler function receives the underlying object as its
first parameter, followed by the signal's other parameters as defied. For
instance:

    local window = Gtk.Window()
    window.on_destroy = function(w)
       assert(w == window)
       print("Destroyed", w)
    end

Note that Lua's syntactic sugar for method definition also applies for signals,
so this is possible:

    local window = Gtk.Window()
    function window:on_destroy()
       assert(self == window)
       print("Destroyed", self)
    end

Reading a signal entity provides a table containing signal details—see
GObject's documentation on signal details for more information on what this
means—but this allows connecting signal handlers to signal details as well,
which is particularly common for handling `notify` signals on properties. To
be notified when a window becomes active or inactive, one can write this:

    local window = Gtk.Window()
    window.on_notify['is-active'] = function(self, pspec)
       assert(self == window)
       assert(pspec.name == 'is-active')
       print("Window is active:", self.is_active)
    end

Both forms of signal connection will connect the handler to be called before the
given signal's default handler. If it is desired to connect after a default
signal handler (see documentation on `G_CONNECT_AFTER` for more details), the
most generic possible connection call must be used e.g.:
`object.on_<signalname>:connect(target, detail, after)`. The previous example
rewritten using this connection style looks like:

    local window = Gtk.Window()
    local function notify_handler(self, pspec)
       assert(self == window)
       assert(pspec.name == 'is-active')
       print("Window is active:", self.is_active)
    end
    window.on_notify:connect(notify_handler, 'is-active', false)

#### 3.4.2 Emitting Signals

Emitting an existing signal is usually only necessary in the implementation
of a subclass. The simplest method to do so is to "call" the signal on the
object instance as if it where a function. For instance, for an object `window`
which subclasses `Gtk.Window`, to emit the parent class' `destroy` signal one
can write:

    window:on_destroy()

### 3.5. Dynamic Typing of GObjects

LuaGObject assigns real class types to instances dynamically by using runtime
GObject-Introspection facilities. When a new class' instance is passed from C
code into Lua, LuaGObject queries the underlying type of the object and finds
the underlying type in its loaded repository then assigns this type to the
Lua-side proxy for the created object. This means casting is unnecessary in
LuaGObject, and it provides no facilities to do so.

See the following example. Assume `demo.ui` is a GtkBuilder XML UI file
containing a definition for a `Gtk.Window` labelled `window1` and a `GtkAction`
called `action1`:

    local builder = Gtk.Builder()
    builder:add_from_file('demo.ui')
    local window = builder:get_object('window1')
    -- Call Gtk.Window-specific method
    window:iconify()
    local action = builder:get_object('action1')
    -- Set Gtk.Action-specific property
    action.sensitive = false

Although the method `Gtk.Builder:get_object()` is marked as returning a
`GObject *`, LuaGObject will actually check the real type of the returned
object and assign a proper type to it, so the first call into `:get_object()`
above will return a `Gtk.Window` while the second returns a `Gtk.Action`.

Another mechanism which allows LuaGObject to forgo casting is automatic
interface discovery—if a given class implements some interface, the properties
and methods of the interface are automatically made available on the object
from Lua code.

### 3.6. Accessing an Object's Class Instance

On all GObject instances, LuaGObject implements a pseudo-property named
`_class`, which can be used to query various pieces of information on an
object's underlying class. As an example, one can list each of an object's
properties by:

    function dump_props(obj)
       print("Dumping properties of ", obj)
       for _, pspec in pairs(obj._class:list_properties()) do
          print(pspec.name, pspec.value_type)
       end
    end

Calling `dump_props(Gtk.Window())` gives the following output:

    Dumping props of	LuaGObject.obj 0xe5c070:Gtk.Window(GtkWindow)
    name	    gchararray
    parent  GtkContainer
    width-request	gint
    height-request	gint
    visible gboolean
    sensitive   gboolean
    (etc ...)

### 3.7. Querying the Type of an Object Instance

To query whether any arbitrary value is actually an instance of a specified
class or subclass, classes in LuaGObject define an `is_type_of` static method.
This method takes one argument and checks whether the given argument is an
object of the class on which `is_type_of` is being called.

    local window = Gtk.Window()
    print(Gtk.Window:is_type_of(window))    -- prints 'true'
    print(Gtk.Widget:is_type_of(window))    -- prints 'true'
    print(Gtk.Buildable:is_type_of(window)) -- prints 'true'
    print(Gtk.Action:is_type_of(window))    -- prints 'false'
    print(Gtk.Window:is_type_of('string'))  -- prints 'false'
    print(Gtk.Window:is_type_of(nil))       -- prints 'false'

It is even possible to get an object's type table by using the `_type`
pseudo-property:

    function same_type(template, unknown)
       local type = template._type
       return type:is_type_of(unknown)
    end

### 3.8. Defining and Implementing Subclasses

It is entirely possible to define and implement a child class of an existing
class in LuaGObject entirely from Lua code, allowing you to implement different
versions of the parent class' virtual methods as well as implementing new
interfaces not implemented by a parent.

To create a subclass, LuaGObject first requires you to make a `package` which
will contain a new namespace wherein your subclass will exist. To do so, call
`LuaGObject.package(name)` like so:

    local MyApp = LuaGObject.package 'MyApp'

Once a package has been created, it will exist on the `LuaGObject` table as any
other namespace would:

    local Gtk = LuaGObject.Gtk
    local MyApp = LuaGObject.MyApp

To create a subclass, call `class(name, parent[, interface_list])` on your
package namespace:

    MyApp:class('MyWidget', Gtk.Widget)
    MyApp:class('MyModel, GObject.Object, { Gio.ListModel })

Once created, a new class will behave exactly like other classes in namespaces
discovered through GObject-Introspection.

    local widget = MyApp.MyWidget()

### 3.8.1. Defining New Methods

A subclass can be extended by defining and implementing new methods on it. To
do so is quite simple.

    function MyApp.MyWidget:speak()
        print "I am a custom widget!"
    end

To make subclasses more useful, LuaGObject provides a `priv` table on each
subclass, which can hold instance variables:

    function MyApp.MyWidget:set_invisible(invisible)
        self.priv.invisible = invisible
    end

### 3.8.2. Overriding Virtual Methods

A subclass is not very useful if it doesn't override any virtual methods
inherited from its parent or interfaces. LuaGObject exposes each virtual method
as `do_<name>`, which can be overridden by assigning it on the child class. For
example, to override `Gtk.Widget`'s `show` function:

    function MyApp.MyWidget:do_show()
        if not self.priv.invisible then
            -- Forward the call explicitly to a specific parent class
            Gtk.Widget.do_show(self)
            -- Query the class' parent and call the function
            MyApp.MyWidget._parent.do_show(self)
            -- Equivalent to super.do_show() in OOP languages
            self._type._parent.do_show(self)
        end
    end

**Please note** that virtual methods inherited from interfaces and the parent
class must be overridden before constructing the first instance of your child
class, so it's best to define them immediately after creating the subclass.

### 3.8.3. Installing New Properties

To install new properties on a derived class, assign new instances of
`GObject.ParamSpec` to the `_property` table which LuaGObject makes available
on all subclasses. Note that as with virtual methods, these must be installed
before the first instance of the subclass is created.

    MyApp.MyWidget._property['my-label'] = GObject.ParamSpecString(
        'my-label', 'Nick string', 'Blurb string', 'Default value',
        { 'READBLE', 'WRITABLE', 'CONSTRUCT' })

    function MyApp.MyWidget:speak()
        print(self.my_label)
    end

    local my_widget = MyApp.MyWidget {
        my_label = 'A custom label',
    }

    my_widget:speak() -- Prints: 'A custom label'
    my_widget.my_label = my_widget.my_label .. ', further customized!'
    my_widget:speak() -- Prints: 'A custom label, further customized!'

Notice that as with all other classes, the dash (`-`) in the property's name is
mapped to an underscore when accessing it in Lua. As the prior convention is to
use dashes in property names, it is recommended to do so in your custom
properties as well.

# 3.8.4. Custom Getters and Setters

It is possible to specify custom getter and setter methods by assigning to the
class' `_property_get` and `_property_set` tables. By default, the value of a
new property is mirrored to an instances's `priv` table, allowing for direct
access from Lua without invoking a getter or setter. See this example of
assigning a custom setter for `my-label`:

    function MyApp.MyWidget._property_set:my_label(new_value)
        -- Note that `self` here is correctly set to the object instance.
        print(('%s changed my-label from %s to %s'):format(
            self, self.priv.my_label, new_value))
        self.priv.my_label = new_value
    end
    local widget = MyApp.MyWidget()

    -- Access through GObject's property machinery
    widget.my_label = 'label1'
    print(widget.my_label)

    -- Direct access to underlying storage
    print(widget.priv.my_label)

As noted before, LuaGObject automatically maps the dash to an underscore when
accessing a property, and that includes defining custom getters or setters as
well as direct access through `priv`.

## 4. Structures and Unions

LuaGObject supports structures and unions in a way similar to classes. Structs
and unions can only have methods (as with classes) and fields, which are similar
to properties.

### 4.1. Creating Instances

Instances of a struct are created by calling the struct's namespace as a
function, e.g. `local color = Gdk.RGBA()`. For structures without constructors,
newly-created instances are zero-initialized, but it is also possible to pass
a table containing fields and values to assign to them, such as
`local blue = Gdk.RGBA { blue = 1, alpha = 1 }`.

If a struct type defines a constructor named `new`, then it is automatically
mapped by LuaGObject to the struct's callable, so calling
`local main_loop = GLib.MainLoop(nil, false)` is identical to calling
`local main_loop = GLib.MainLoop.new(nil, false)`.

### 4.2. Calling Methods and Accessing Fields

A struct's methods are called exactly as with class instances:

    local loop = GLib.MainLoop(nil, false)
    loop:run()
    -- ...which is equivalent to...
    GLib.MainLoop.run(loop)

Fields are accessed using Lua's `.` operator on a struct instance:

    local color = Gdk.RGBA { alpha = 1 }
    color.green = 0.5
    print(color.red, color.green, color.alpha)
    -- Prints: 0    0.5    1

## 5. Enumerations, Bitflags, and Constants

LuaGObject maps enumeration values to strings containing the the names of each
given value, where values from a given enum are expected:

    local label = Gtk.Label()
    label.halign = 'START' -- Sets halign to the value of GTK_ALIGN_START

LuaGObject creates tables for all enum and bitflag types in its repository,
with names mapping to their underlying numeric values. The numeric value can
thus be accessed by indexing its name on the type within the namespace. The
previous example is equivalent to:

    label.halign = Gtk.Align.START

That said, accessing enum values in this way is seldom necessary.

Bitflags are handled similarly to enums:

    label:set_state_flags 'INSENSITIVE'

To combine multiple bitflags, list all the names in the array part of a table:

    label:set_state_flags { 'INSENSITIVE', 'BACKDROP' }

This is equivalent to performing a bitwise OR on these values, except it's
substantially more convenient and—for versions of Lua without bitwise
operators—much easier to do.

You can even pass a numeric value instead if known, though it's not recommended:

    label:set_state_flags(32)

### 5.1. Optional Enum and Bitflag Values

In the above example, only one parameter was passed to
`Gtk.Widget:set_state_flags` even though it takes a second argument—a boolean
value. If `nil` is given (or the parameter is elided), LuaGObject assumes
`false`. The same applies to enums and bitflags—if `nil` is passed or a function
parameter is elided, it will be treated as a value of 0 instead. Thus, these
function calls are equivalent:

    label:set_state_flags(0, false)
    label:set_state_flags()

### 5.2. Getting Names from Numeric Values

LuaGObject also allows a reverse lookup of enum names from known values by
indexing an enum type's table with a number:

    print(Gtk.Align[0]) -- Prints 'FILL'

Note that enums are 0-indexed in order to map exact values to their names.

Indexing a bitflag type's table with a number will return a table containing
value nicknames in the array part:

    for _, v in pairs(Gtk.StateFlags[3]) do
        print(v)
    end

This previous example prints 'ACTIVE' and 'PRELIGHT'.

Using this technique, it is possible to check for the presence of a specified
flag very easily:

    if Gtk.StateFlags[flags].SELECTED then
       -- Code handling selected case
    end

If ever a value cannot be cleanly decomposed into flags, the remaining bits are
OR'd into a numeric value stored at index 1.

Occasionally, if a type definition contains inconsistent flags, simply passing
an array table of nicknames may not produce correct results. For these cases,
LuaGObject provides a pseudo-constructor for explicitly constructing bitflag
values types accepting a table of nicknames and numeric values as its argument:

    label:set_state_flags(Gtk.StateFlags { 4, 'FOCUSED', Gtk.StateFlags.LINK })

## 6. Threading and Synchronization

Lua does not allow for concurrency within a single Lua state, which rules out
compatibility with GLib's threading API. Though concurrency can't be used from
Lua, libraries wrapped by LuaGObject may still use threads internally. This
can lead to situations where callbacks and signals are invoked from different
threads. To avoid corrupting the Lua state, LuaGObject uses a single lock
(mutex) preventing simultaneous access to Lua. LuaGObject will automatically
acquire a lock when moving execution from C to Lua (such as by invoking a
callback or returning from a C call) and will release the lock when moving
from Lua to C (such as returning from a Lua callback or calling a C function).

In a typical GLib-based application, most of the runtime is spent inside of
GLib's main loop. During the main loop, LuaGObject's lock is unlocked and
mainloop can invoke Lua callbacks and signals as needed. This means that
an application based on LuaGObject will automatically synchronize threads as
as needed.

The only situation requiring manual intervention is if GLib's main loop is not
being used by your application (such as Copas scheduler or a QT GUI). In this
case, LuaGObject's thread lock is locked at nearly all times which also prevents
callbacks and signal event handlers from being called. To cope with this,
LuaGObject provides the function `LuaGObject.yield()` which unlocks the
LuaGObject lock when called, allowing the execution of callbacks and signal
handlers originating from other threads. Once all queued callbacks and signal
event handlers have resolved, LuaGObject reacquires the lock and execution is
passed back to the Lua state. By adding a call to `LuaGObject.yield()` to
another mainloop, threaded libraries can communicate back to your Lua state in
a timely manner.

## 7. Logging

GLib provides logging functions using `g_message` and similar C macros. These
are not usable directly in Lua, so LuaGObject provides a layer to access this
functionality.

All logging is controlled by the `LuaGObject.log` table. To allow logging from
Lua, call the `LuaGObject.log.domain(name)` function with the name of your
application of library. This function returns a table containing functions named
`message`, `warning`, `critical`, `error`, and `debug`—each of these functions
takes a single format string and any number of additional parameters following
the same rules as Lua's `string.format` method. A typical example is:

    local LuaGObject = require 'LuaGObject'
    local log = LuaGObject.log.domain('MyApp')

    -- This is equivalent to 'g_message("A message %d", 1)' in C.
    log.message('A message %d', 1)

    -- This is equivalent to 'g_warning("Not found")' in C.
    log.warning 'Not found'

## 8. Native Interoperability

There may be times where it is important to export either objects of records
created in Lua to C code or vice-versa. LuaGObject allows transferring from Lua
to C using Lua's `lightuserdata` type. To get a native pointer from any object
instance, the `_native` attribute returns a pointer when queried:

    -- Create Lua-side window object.
    local window = Gtk.Window { title = 'Hello' }
    
    -- Get native pointer to this object.
    local window_ptr = window._native

The variable `window_ptr` now holds a pointer to the `Gtk.Window` object.

To use a pointer from the C side of things, use Lua's API:

    // window_ptr can be now passed to C code, which can use it.
    GtkWindow *window = lua_touserdata (L, x);
    char *title;
    g_object_get (window, "title", &title);
    g_assert (g_str_equal (title, "Hello"));
    g_free (title);

An object created from the C side can also be passed to Lua as a `lightuserdata`
value:

    // Create object on the C side and pass it to Lua
    GtkButton *button = gtk_button_new_with_label ("Foreign");
    lua_pushlightuserdata (L, button);
    lua_call (L, ...);

Assuming the call is to a function taking an argument named `button`, the
userdata can be passed to the appropriate class' constructor as a parameter:

    -- Retrieve button on the Lua side.
    assert(type(button) == 'userdata')
    box:append(Gtk.Button(button))

This isn't limited to classes—the same can be done with structs and unions.

## 9. GObject

Although GObject is unsurisingly compatible with GObject-Introspection, most of
that library's elements are quite basic and to make programming in Lua simpler,
LuaGObject provides special handling for certain GObject features.

### 9.1. GObject.Type

Unlike C's `GType` representation (which is an unsigned integer), LuaGObject
will represent `GType` values by name as a string. Related constants and methods
useful for handling `GType` values are present in the `GObject.Type` namespace.

Fundamental `GType` names are imported as constants into the `GObject.Type`
namespace similarly to other enums, so it is possible to use `GObject.Type.INT`
where `G_TYPE_INT` would be used in C code.

The available constants are `NONE`, `INTERFACE`, `CHAR`, `UCHAR`, `BOOLEAN`,
`INT`, `UINT`, `LONG`, `ULONG`, `INT64`, `UINT64`, `ENUM`, `FLAGS`, `FLOAT`,
`DOUBLE`, `STRING`, `POINTER`, `BOXED`, `PARAM`, `OBJECT`, and `VARIANT`.

Additionally, functions operating on `GType` values are also present in the
`GObject.Type` namespace:

- `GObject.Type.parent()`
- `GObject.Type.depth()`
- `GObject.Type.next_base()`
- `GObject.Type.is_a()`
- `GObject.Type.children()`
- `GObject.Type.interfaces()`
- `GObject.Type.query()`
- `GObject.Type.fundamental_next()`
- `GObject.Type.fundamental()`

There is also a new function named `GObject.Type.type(name)` which returns the
LuaGObject-native type representing the named `GType`. For example, calling
`GObject.Type.type 'GtkWindow'` will return `Gtk.Window`:

    assert(Gtk.Window == GObject.Type.type('GtkWindow'))

When passing a `GType` value from Lua to C, you can use either a string with the
type's name, a number representing the underlying numeric `GType` value, or any
loaded component with a type assigned. Some examples:

    LuaGObject = require 'LuaGObject'
    GObject = LuaGObject.GObject
    Gtk = LuaGObject.Gtk

    print(GObject.Type.NONE)
    print(GObject.Type.name(GObject.Type.NONE))
    -- prints "void" in both cases

    print(GObject.Type.name(Gtk.Window))
    -- prints "GtkWindow"

    print(GObject.Type.is_a(Gtk.Window, GObject.Type.OBJECT))
    -- prints "true"

    print(GObject.Type.parent(Gtk.Window))
    -- prints "GtkWidget"

### 9.2. GObject.Value

LuaGObject does not implement any automatic `GValue` boxing or unboxing,
because this would involve guessing the `GType` of a Lua value and that is
generally unsafe. Instead, easy to use and convenient wrappers for
accessing `GValue` types and contents are provided.

#### 9.2.1. Creating GValues

To create new `GObject.Value` instances, 'call' `GObject.Value` as with classes
and other LuaGObject types. The call has two optional arguments, specifying
the `GType` of the newly created `GValue` and also the contents of resulting
value. A few examples:

    local LuaGObject = require 'LuaGObject'
    local GObject = LuaGObject.GObject
    local Gtk = LuaGObject.Gtk

    local empty = GObject.Value()
    local answer = GObject.Value(GObject.Type.INT, 42)
    local null_window = GObject.Value(Gtk.Window)
    local window = GObject.Value(Gtk.Window, Gtk.Window())

#### 9.2.2. Boxing and Unboxing GValues

`GObject.Value` adds two new pseudo-properties to `GValue` called `gtype` and
`value` which contain the underlying type and value respectively. Both
pseudo-properties readable and writable. Reading them will query the `GValue`'s
current state by performing actual unboxing of the underlying `GValue`'s native
data. Writing to `value` will perform boxing on the given Lua value. Writing to
`gtype` will change the type of the `GValue` and if it already has a value, it
will be converted using `g_value_transform()`. Some examples:

    assert(empty.gtype == nil)
    assert(empty.value == nil)
    assert(answer.gtype == GObject.Type.INT)
    assert(answer.value == 42)
    assert(null_window.gtype == 'GtkWindow')
    assert(null_window.value == nil)

    empty.gtype = answer.gtype
    empty.value = 1
    assert(empty.gtype == GObject.Type.INT)
    assert(empty.value == 1)
    answer.gtype = GObject.Type.STRING)
    assert(answer.value == '42')

Although `GObject.Value` provides most of the methods provided by the `GValue`
type for querying and setting data (e.g.: `g_value_get_string()` can be called
by calling `GObject.Value.get_string()`, and `g_value_set_string()` can be
called by calling `GObject.Value.set_string()`), it is recommended to always
use the `value` and `gtype` pseudo-properties provided by LuaGObject.

### 9.3. GObject.Closure

Like with `GObject.Value` types, LuaGObject does not provide automatic boxing
for `GClosure`s. To create a `GClosure` one must explicitly invoke its
constructor by calling `GObject.Closure()` and passing a Lua function as its
argument:

    local closure = GObject.Closure(func)

When the closure is executed, the given Lua function is called. The function
receives `GObject.Value`s as arguments and it must return a `GObject.Value` as
specified by the libraries being used.
